# Espurna over MQTT
This is an app for [Homey](https://homey.app/en-us/) that adds support for selected devices running the excellent [Espurna](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna) firmware, controlled over MQTT via an MQTT server.
## Supported devices
For my use cases, which are the three (3) options supported by this app, I'm running Espurna on:

- Huacanxing H801 RGB LED controllers
- Itead Sonoff Basic
- Itead Sonoff Dual

The H801 can be run to control either RGB LEDs on channels 1-3 or white LEDs on either channel 4 or 5, selectable from the app's Advanced Settings.

The Sonoff Basic is a single relay in-line power switch and the Sonoff Dual is a dual relay.
## Server
For the server I run [Eclipse Mosquittoâ„¢](https://mosquitto.org/) on a Mac mini server (running macOS 11 Big Sur) installed using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Simply install Homebrew then `brew install mosquitto` to install the server. Mosquitto runs well on Linux or even a Raspberry Pi, and other MQTT server options are available: the MQTT client component used in the app is mature, stable and widely used so should connect to almost any server.
## Server configuration
Minimal server configuration is necessary: just the IP address and port number of the MQTT server. The app will pull defaults from the `env.json` file. If you want to use username and password authentication this is supported but SSL connections aren't.
## Still to do in a future release
- The API needs to be added in `api.js`  so that other applications can interact with the devices
- More flow cards
- Additional languages other than English
- Add separate option (driver and assets etc.) for H801s controlling white LEDs: there is no way in a Homey app to dynamically disable a capability so even though you use the Advanced Settings to tell the app that it's controlling white LEDs the colour picker remains in the app
- Support more Espurna devices as my willingness to suffer the interminable wait for items to arrive from Ali Express returns from its current level of zero
